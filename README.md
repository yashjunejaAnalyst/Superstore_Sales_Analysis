Superstore Retail Performance Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI

**ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective:**

To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into sales, profit, customer segments, and operational performance across different U.S. states, product categories, and time periodsâ€”enabling retail decision-makers to optimize strategy and operations.

**ðŸ§­ Project Approach:**

1.) Data Preparation:

 - Cleaned and structured raw retail transaction data.

 - Performed data transformations and created relationships between datasets (e.g., orders, returns, customer segments).

2.) Power BI Development:

 - Built visual reports to analyze key metrics like:

 - Sales, Quantity, Profit, and Returns

 - Delivery Time and Shipping Modes

 - Sales by Category, Segment, Payment Mode, and Sub-Category

 - Integrated geo-spatial visualization (map) to analyze regional performance by state.

 - Added time-series charts to show YoY trends in monthly sales and profit.

3.) Advanced Features:

 - Included slicers to filter data by region (Central, East, South, West).

 - Used DAX measures for dynamic KPI calculations (e.g., average delivery days, state-wise contribution).

 - Created comparative bar charts and donut charts for better business insights.

**ðŸ“ˆ Outcome from the Project:**

 - Delivered a dynamic, executive-level dashboard to visualize performance across 233 U.S. cities.

 - Identified top-performing states (e.g., California, New York) and high-profit subcategories (e.g., Phones, Chairs).

 - Enabled visibility into delivery efficiency (103-day avg), sales segmentation, and payment preferences.

 - Provided actionable business intelligence to optimize sales strategy, improve logistics, and identify regional or product-based performance gaps.
